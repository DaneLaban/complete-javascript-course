-------- SIDE NOTE ---------
NUMBER: Numbers => Used for decimals and integers. ex| let age = 23;

STRING: Sequence of characters => Text. ex| let firstName = "Kobe";

BOOLEAN: Can ONLY be 'TRUE' or 'FALSE' => Taking decisions. ex| let fullAge = true;

Undefined: Value is taken by a variable that is not defined aka empty value. ex| let children;

Null: Also an empty value. ex| let kids;

Symbol: Value is unique and cannot be changed.

BigInt: Larger integers than the Number type can hold.
